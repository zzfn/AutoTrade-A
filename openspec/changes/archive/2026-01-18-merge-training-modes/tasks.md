## 1. Implementation

- [x] 1.1 Consolidate backend API endpoints: valid separate `rolling_update` API might be merged or generalized into `train`.
- [x] 1.2 Update Frontend UI (`models.html`) to remove the separate "Rolling Training" card and add a meaningful "Train Model" button/modal that covers both cases.
- [x] 1.3 Ensure the unified training flow supports selecting/inputting symbols and time ranges (or defaults to auto-rolling).
- [x] 1.4 Validate that the unified process correctly saves new model versions.
